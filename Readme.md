## What is PON Reporter

In the Proof of Neutrality (PoN) relay, a reporter plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and security of the protocol. The primary function of a reporter is to scrutinize the activities of proposers and builders, ensuring that they adhere to the rules and regulations of the network.

Through a process of consistent monitoring and validation, reporters act as watchdogs for the PoN relay, providing an independent and impartial assessment of the actions of proposers and builders. In doing so, they help to ensure that the network remains secure and trustworthy, and that any wrongdoing is detected, reported, and met with consequences.

Reporters are incentivized with rewards for reporting wrongdoing, taking a portion of funds from the reported party and splitting it with the payout pool. By collecting these rewards, reporters stay motivated to remain vigilant and ensure the continued success of the PoN relay.
